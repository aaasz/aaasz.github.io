                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I am a Researcher at Microsoft, where I have been working since April 2025. With a strong background in the theory and practice of <strong>parallel and distributed systems</strong>, I focus on building dependable systems that are secure, robust, and functionally correct.</p>

            <p>I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington, where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Henry M. Levy, Prof. Arvind Krishnamurthy, and Prof. Dan R. K. Ports as part of the Systems Lab. My doctoral research concentrated on distributed systems, transaction processing, consistency models, and replication protocols.</p>
            
            <p>Following my Ph.D., I began my industry career as a Researcher at VMware in September 2020, where I spent three years advancing distributed systems research. When Broadcom acquired VMware, I continued my work as a Researcher at Broadcom from October 2023 to April 2025, before joining Microsoft Research.</p>
            
            <p>My research has been published in top-tier conferences including SIGMOD, OSDI, SOSP, EuroSys, and DISC. <a href="research.html">View my research papers →</a></p>
